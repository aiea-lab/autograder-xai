You are writing a program to help design signs for a local community fair. 
Your program will receive a slogan from each participant and needs to be able to transform the sentence 
into the desired format so it can be neatly fit onto a sign that follows the fair's specifications.

The fair's specifications are as follows:
* Each sign must have a top and a bottom border.
* Each sign must have exactly one word per line, save for the border lines which must not have any words.
* A word containing a special character (that isn't a letter or a number) is an error and the whole word should be removed!
* Each sign must be wide enough for every word to fit properly within its borders, with at exactly one space on either side of each word.

For example, the slogan "Hello world in a frame" would be displayed as:
*********
* Hello *
* world *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********

Write your solution in the function 'frame_printing' below:

When you're ready to test, please run: `python grader.py` or `python3 grader.py`, depending on your system's configuration.

This problem is also being supported by an explanation tool we've been developing in my lab.

This tool aims to help you figure out a good structure for your solution and help you pinpoint the reason behind certain errors.
When you submit your code, some feedback from the tool will be included in your output.

Feel free to use it as much as you want!
